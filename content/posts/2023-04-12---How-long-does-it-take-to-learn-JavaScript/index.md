JavaScript retained its position as the most used programming language for the [tenth consecutive year](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) in 2022. As a result, demand and compensation for JavaScript developers have increased in the last decade. JS developers are reported to be [paid](https://arc.dev/salaries/javascript-developers) $71,263 remotely.

If you're considering to learn JavaScript, this is the best time. But before starting, you might be thinking, how long does it take to learn JavaScript?

In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the factors that can influence the time it takes to learn JavaScript and provide great tips and resources for you to learn JavaScript effectively.

## Factors Affecting the Time to Learn JavaScript:

Let's examine some of the key factors that can shape your journey to JavaScript proficiency-

### 1. Your Background in Programming:

Your prior experience with programming languages such as Java, C, C++ etc. will affect how long it takes to learn JavaScript. Familiarity with concepts like variables, loops, and functions will enable you to focus on the unique aspects of JavaScript. For someone without any programming experience, learning these fundamental concepts might take longer.

### 2. Time Investment:

The amount of time you can dedicate to learning JavaScript will impact the duration of your learning process. If you can allocate 3-5 hours a day to learning, you may be able to master JavaScript in just a few months. However, if you can only spare 5-10 hours a week, it may take you more than a year to become proficient.

### 3. Learning Resources:

The quality and type of learning resources you use can also influence how long it takes to learn JavaScript. Some people may find success with online tutorials and videos, while others may prefer attending coding boot camps or taking formal classes. It's essential to choose the right resources that cater to your learning style and needs.

## How long does it take to learn JavaScript?

Everyone learns at a different speed. But based on our own experience, that of our friends, and resources available on the internet, we suggest the below rules of thumb for experienced developers and newbies:

### Experienced Developers

If you are a programmer experienced in another stack, you might be able to get to coding in vanilla Javascript in 10-20 hours. Consider adding ~2X of that time to pick up the basics of some modern JS frameworks, such as React or Vue. This way, you can start building basic, but functional frontends within a week or two using a JS framework.

Using a component library like [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), etc., can reduce your learning curve even further, as with them, you won't have to write most components from scratch anymore.

If you are in this group, consider learning from examples once you have got the basics of Javascript as a language. You can find many examples of working fully frontend code using: [Material UI](https://github.com/MiladSadeghi/molla-ecommerce-react) and [Chakra](https://github.com/codebender828/miro-landing-chakra/).

Reviewing these codebases, and trying to find how they have implemented the particular things you need to implement (e.g. a [menu](https://github.com/MiladSadeghi/molla-ecommerce-react/blob/master/src/components/Navbar/Navbar.js) or a [login](https://github.com/MiladSadeghi/molla-ecommerce-react/blob/master/src/components/Navbar/SignIn.js) page), can be a great way to ramp up quickly.

### Newbie Developers

On the other end of the spectrum - if you have little to no experience in programming and want to pick up Javascript well enough to qualify for the frontend roles - you'd need anything in the range of 400-800 hours of effort. That's 3-4 hours daily for 5-9 months.

This should include learning from resources such as courses/ books/ online videos, but perhaps even more importantly - lots of practicing and building stuff. Choosing a well-structured course, either online or offline, can be beneficial because then, you won't have to worry about structuring your learning path, i.e., what topic you should pick up after what.

If you are choosing to go with a self-driven learning path (e.g. lots of disparate videos on youtube), try to follow the course outlines of one other structured courses (e.g. [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) or [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript)). Either way, remember to spend at least half of your time coding and building side projects.

## Tips to learn JavaScript efficiently

Overall, it will take you at least 6-12 months of learning and practice to become a proficient, employable JavaScript developer if you have never coded before. Follow these tips for smoother learning experience:

- **Break down the learning process**: Divide the JavaScript learning process into smaller, manageable goals. This will make the learning process less overwhelming and help you track your progress more efficiently.

- **Practice regularly**: Consistent practice is crucial for mastering JavaScript. The more time you spend coding, the more proficient you will become. Try to dedicate time every day or week to practicing JavaScript. Follow challenges like JavaScript30 and #100DaysOfCode to build consistency.

- **Seek support from the community**: Engaging with fellow learners or experienced developers can provide valuable insights, feedback, and encouragement. Join online forums, JavaScript related Discord and Slack communities, local meetups etc. to connect with others and share your learning experience.

- **Work on real-world projects**: Apply your JavaScript knowledge to real-world projects. Building your portfolio with practical projects will not only help reinforce your learning but also demonstrate your skills to potential employers.

- **Stay up-to-date with industry trends**: The world of JavaScript is continuously evolving. Keep up with the latest developments in libraries, frameworks, and best practices to stay relevant and informed.
