Vue, on the other hand, has over 203,000 stars on [Vue2 repo](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) with over 350 contributors and over 30,000 stars on [Vue3](https://github.com/vuejs/core) with an approximately similar number of contributors as of April 2023.

While React has a larger user base, Vue has also seen a significant increase in popularity in recent years.

### 2. Maturity

React is considered a more mature front-end framework compared to Vue due to its more established ecosystem. Since its release in 2013, React has had over a decade of development, which has led to a robust community of developers and a plethora of resources and tools available.

React has been widely adopted by big tech companies such as Facebook, Instagram, and Netflix, which has contributed to its continuous growth and evolution.

Vue, although relatively newer compared to React, has still been around since 2014, giving it ample time to develop and mature. Over the years, Vue has established itself as a straightforward and flexible framework that is easy to learn and use. Its popularity has grown significantly due to its unique features, such as reactive components and simple syntax.

This has led to the development of a strong and dedicated community of developers, an expanding ecosystem, and a growing number of resources and tools available. While not yet as widely adopted by big tech companies as React, Vue continues to gain traction and evolve, showcasing its maturity and potential for future growth.

### 3. Tooling

Both React and Vue have a range of tools and libraries available, which makes it easier for developers to build complex applications.

React's extensive ecosystem includes popular libraries such as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and more. Redux is a predictable state container that helps manage the state of an application, while React Router provides a simple way to navigate between different parts of a web application. Next.js, on the other hand, is a popular framework that helps build server-rendered React applications.

Vue's tooling options include [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) among many others. Vuex is a state management library for Vue applications, providing a central store for managing data. Vue Router provides routing functionality for Vue applications, allowing developers to easily define and navigate between routes. Nuxt.js is a framework for building server-side rendered Vue.js applications.

### 4. Performance

Both React and Vue can develop high-performance applications and can handle complex applications with ease. React uses a virtual DOM for the efficient rendering of changes, whereas Vue also uses a template-based syntax along with a virtual DOM for rendering changes.

React's virtual DOM allows for fast updates and rendering of the UI, which makes it highly performant. Vue's virtual DOM also allows for efficient updates and rendering of the UI.

However, React's virtual DOM is generally considered to be faster than Vue's virtual DOM.

### 5. Learning curve

React and Vue both have a learning curve, but Vue is generally considered easier to learn. Vue's template-based syntax and simpler API make it easier for developers who are new to web development.

React has a steeper learning curve than Vue, which means that it can take longer for new developers to get up to speed. React also has a relatively complex API, which requires developers to understand concepts such as state, props, and lifecycle methods.

Vue uses templates, which are similar to HTML and can be easier for developers to understand.

### 6. Developer satisfaction

### 9. Mobile App Development

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is a popular mobile development framework that is based on React. React Native allows developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React.

Vue also had a mobile development framework, [Vue Native](https://vue-native.io/), which was designed to make it easier for developers to build native mobile apps using Vue and it provided a number of benefits over other mobile development frameworks.

Unfortunately, Vue Native had not seen the same level of adoption as React Native and has been deprecated since November 2021 due to the team's limited resources and the fact that the project did not gain enough traction among the community.

So, when it comes to mobile app development, React is the clear winner.

## React vs Vue: Which one is better for your use case?

Both React and Vue have their vocal proponents. Devs who prefer React often cite these reasons for their preference- [Better TypeScript compatibility](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/why-i-finally-chose-react-over-vue-f090cb0e097a), [Smaller API surface](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/why-i-prefer-react-over-vue/), etc.

On the other hand, devs who prefer Vue cite these reasons for their preference- [Simplicity](https://dev.to/gautemeekolsen/why-i-prefer-vue-over-react-3jm6), [Performance](https://betterprogramming.pub/when-to-use-vue-over-react-9a4e0f01e064) etc.

In general, if you are building a large-scale application and need a highly performant framework, React may be your best choice. On the other hand, if you need a simpler framework with a lower learning curve, then Vue may be the best choice for you.

Regardless of which framework you choose, you can expect an abundance of tools and libraries at your disposal to help you build complex applications efficiently.

_Happy Coding!_
