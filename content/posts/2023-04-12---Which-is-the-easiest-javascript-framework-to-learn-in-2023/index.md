**TLDR**: _Many experience devs agree that Vue and Svelte are the two easiest JavaScript frameworks. Both frameworks offer gentle learning curves, simple syntax, and intuitive data binding, making them more approachable than React and Angular. Vue is an excellent choice for those who appreciate HTML-like syntax with custom directives, while Svelte is ideal for developers seeking a framework that remains close to pure JavaScript. With real-world examples and detailed code reviews, this article helps new developers navigate the world of JavaScript frameworks more confidently._

Vue and Svelte are two such frameworks that have gained popularity for their ease of use and accessibility to beginners. Vue has a minimalistic syntax and an [easy-to-understand](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/10/20/why-we-chose-vue/) templating system, while Svelte compiles applications at build time, reducing the amount of code needed to build web applications.

Because of this, both these frameworks have received a lot of love from developers in recent times.

In this blog post, we will provide you with a thorough comparison of both these frameworks, exploring their ease of use, learning curve, and overall developer experience.

## Overview of Vue and Svelte

Before diving into the specifics, let's briefly introduce the two easiest JavaScript frameworks we'll be comparing in this article:

### Vue.js

Created by Evan You in 2014, Vue.js is a progressive framework that has gained immense popularity due to its gentle learning curve, flexibility, and extensive documentation. It's known for its approachable syntax and modular architecture.

Here are two great resources for you to start learning Vue- [Vue JS Crash Course](https://youtu.be/qZXt1Aom3Cs) by Brad Traversy and courses by [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/).

### Svelte

Developed by Rich Harris in 2016, Svelte is a relatively newer framework that compiles your code into small, efficient JavaScript modules during build time, resulting in minimal runtime overhead. Its clean syntax and minimal boilerplate make it an attractive option for developers looking for simplicity and performance.

## Why Vue and Svelte are the Easiest JavaScript Frameworks?

Vue and Svelte have gained a reputation for being the easiest JavaScript frameworks to learn, particularly for beginners. Let's examine some of the reasons behind this and compare them to other popular frameworks like React and Angular, using real code examples to illustrate our points.

### 1. Gentle Learning Curve

Both Vue and Svelte are known for their gentle learning curves, making them more approachable for beginners compared to React and Angular.

React has a steeper learning curve due to its use of JSX and the need to learn concepts like state management, hooks, and the component lifecycle.

Angular, as a full-fledged framework, requires developers to learn TypeScript, Angular-specific syntax, and a variety of complex concepts like dependency injection, decorators, and modules.

### 2. Simple Syntax and Code Organization

Both Vue and Svelte use a single-file component structure, which makes it easy for developers to understand the code organization. This contrasts with React and Angular, which often require more complex folder structures and multiple files to achieve similar functionality.

#### Vue example:

```html
<template>
  <!-- HTML Markup -->
</template>

<script>
  // JavaScript Code
</script>

<style>
  /* CSS Styles */
</style>
```

#### Svelte example:

```html
<!-- HTML Markup -->
<script>
  // JavaScript Code
</script>

<style>
  /* CSS Styles */
</style>
```

#### React example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import "./App.css";

// Component
function App() {
  // JavaScript Code
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  return <div className="App">{/* HTML-like Markup (JSX) */}</div>;
}

export default App;
```

#### Angular example:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<!-- HTML Markup -->
```

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./app.component.css"],
})
export class AppComponent {
  // TypeScript Code
}
```

#### 3. Intuitive Data Binding and Reactivity

Vue and Svelte offer straightforward data binding and reactivity, which is easier for beginners to understand compared to React's state management with hooks or Angular's two-way data binding using `[(ngModel)]`.

#### Vue example:

```html
<input type="text" v-model="newTask" />
```

#### Svelte example:

```html
<input type="text" bind:value="{newTask}" />
```

#### React example:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [newTask, setNewTask] = useState("");

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={newTask}
      onChange={(e) => setNewTask(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}
```

#### Angular example:

```html
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="newTask" />
```

### 4. Directives vs. Language Constructs

Vue employs custom directives such as `v-model`, `v-for`, and `v-if` for handling various tasks, making it more approachable for developers who are new to frameworks but have a basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.

These directives resemble the template-based syntax found in Angular, which utilizes its own set of directives like `*ngFor` and `*ngIf`. However, Angular's steep learning curve and the need to learn TypeScript make it less suitable for absolute beginners.

Svelte, on the other hand, uses language constructs like `{#each}`, `{#if}`, and two-way binding with `bind:value`, which are closer to pure JavaScript. This makes it more accessible for developers who have a basic understanding of JavaScript but have never used a framework before.

React is unique in its approach, as it uses JSX‚Äîan XML-like syntax embedded in JavaScript‚Äîto handle tasks such as looping and conditional rendering. This requires developers to learn the JSX syntax and understand how it integrates with JavaScript. For someone who has never used a framework before, this might be less intuitive compared to Vue's custom directives or Svelte's language constructs.

#### Vue example:

```html
<ul>
  <li v-for="(task, index) in tasks" :key="index">{{ task }}</li>
</ul>
```

#### Svelte example:

```html
<ul>
  {#each tasks as task, index (task.id)}
  <li>{task}</li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

#### React example:

```jsx
<ul>
  {tasks.map((task, index) => (
    <li key={index}>{task}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

#### Angular example:

```html
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let task of tasks; index as i">{{ task }}</li>
</ul>
```

## Building a To-Do List App with Vue and Svelte

To provide a tangible comparison of the two easiest JavaScript frameworks, we have created a simple "To-Do List" app using both Vue and Svelte. Code is embedded below, feel free to check it out and play with it.

## Code Review

In this section, we will review the code of both To-Do List apps, and discuss why these Vue and Svelte make it easier for new developers to learn JavaScript frameworks.

### Vue.js Code Review

The Vue.js code is divided into three sections within a single file: `template`, `script`, and `style`. This structure makes it easy for developers to understand how the components are organized.

The template section contains HTML-like markup that uses Vue's custom directives such as `v-model`, `v-for`, and `v-if`. These directives are easy to comprehend for someone new to frameworks, as they resemble standard HTML attributes and provide clear, declarative instructions for _data binding_, _loops_, and _conditionals_.

For example:

```html
<input type="text" v-model="newTask" @keyup.enter="addTask" />
```

Here, `v-model` is used for two-way data binding between the input field and the _newTask_ variable. The `@keyup.enter` listens for the "Enter" key press and triggers the _addTask_ method.

The script section is where the component's data and methods are defined. It is written in standard JavaScript and follows a simple object structure. The methods and data are easy to understand, and the Vue instance handles the reactivity and DOM updates automatically.

### Svelte Code Review

Similar to Vue, Svelte's code is organized within a single file with three sections: `HTML markup`, `script`, and `style`. The main difference is that Svelte doesn't use custom directives, but instead uses language constructs that are closer to pure JavaScript.

In the HTML markup, you'll find constructs like `{#each}` and `{#if}` for loops and conditionals, which are similar to JavaScript's native constructs. Two-way binding is achieved using `bind:value`, which is easy to understand for developers familiar with JavaScript.

For instance:

```html
<input
  type="text"
  bind:value="{newTask}"
  on:keyup="{({ key }) => key === 'Enter' && addTask()}"
/>
```

In this example, `bind:value` is used for two-way data binding between the input field and the _newTask_ variable. The `on:keyup` listens for the "Enter" key press and triggers the _addTask_ method.

The script section is also written in standard JavaScript and contains the component's data and methods. Svelte components are reactive by default, which means that the framework automatically handles DOM updates when the data changes.

## Conclusion

In the end, both Vue and Svelte are [excellent](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-vue-and-svelte-here-are-the-differences-c649f8d4ce0a) choices for new developers looking to learn a JavaScript framework. Their gentle learning curves, simple syntax, and intuitive data binding make them more accessible compared to other popular frameworks like React and Angular.

The choice between both of them may also come down to personal preference.

For developers who prefer a more HTML-like syntax with custom directives, Vue might be the better choice. On the other hand, if a developer is looking for a framework that stays closer to pure JavaScript with minimal overhead, Svelte could be a more suitable option.

_Happy Coding!_
