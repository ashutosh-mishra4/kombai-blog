***TLDR**: JavaScript frameworks have revolutionized the way web applications are built and have significantly reduced the development time and effort required to build complex applications. In this article, we explore the top 10 JavaScript frameworks based on factors like popularity, ease of learning, dev satisfaction, job market demand, etc.*

The whole 2010 decade was the era of JavaScript frameworks. Many great frameworks that we know today were born in this decade that have captured the lives of modern developers.

With such huge options, confusion is bound to come. Therefore, in this article, we are going to cover the 10 top JavaScript frameworks and which one should you use depending on your use case.

## What is a JavaScript framework?

A JavaScript framework is a pre-written code that helps developers build applications more efficiently. It provides a structure, tools, and libraries to streamline the development process and make it easier to build complex applications.

Frameworks take care of a lot of the underlying code that developers would otherwise have to write themselves. This means that developers can focus on building unique features and functionality for their applications, rather than getting bogged down with the nitty-gritty of coding.

### Our ranking criteria

To come up with our list of the top JavaScript frameworks, we considered several factors. Here are the criteria we used to identify the best frameworks:

- **Popularity:** We looked at the number of GitHub stars, NPM trends, StackOverflow Developer Survey, etc. to determine the popularity of each framework.

- **Learning curve**: We considered the ease of learning and how quickly developers can start building applications with each framework.

- **Developer satisfaction**: We looked at the Stack Overflow developer survey and other online resources to find out what frameworks are loved by developers and are easy to use.

- **Job market:** We considered the current job market and the demand for developers skilled in each framework.

- **Interest over time**: We looked at *Google Trends* and *NPM Trends* to see how each framework's interest has evolved over time.

## Overview of the best JavaScript frameworks

### 1. React

[React](https://react.dev/) is a frontend JavaScript library created by Meta to build user interfaces and single page applications. It was originally written by Jordan Walke and was first introduced to the world in 2013 at JSConfUS.

React uses a component-based architecture. Components are reusable and encapsulated pieces of code that can be composed to build complex user interfaces. This makes it easier to manage and maintain large codebases and also promotes code reuse.

For optimal performance, it uses Virtual DOM which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React uses to keep track of changes to the UI. This allows React to update the UI efficiently without re-rendering the entire page.

According to the 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, React is the most popular frontend JavaScript framework and is used in large products like Facebook, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, etc.

Use React if you are building a large-scale application with complex user interfaces, cross platform application, or need a flexible library that allows you to make your own decisions about project structure and architecture.

### 2. Angular

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a TypeScript based framework used for building web applications. Its early version AngularJS was launched by Google in 2010 which they rewrote and relaunched in 2016 as Angular.

Like many other front-end frameworks, Angular uses a component-based architecture to break down user interfaces into smaller, reusable parts. It also provides a powerful two-way data binding system that allows changes to the application's data to automatically update the UI and vice versa. This makes it easy to create complex, interactive user interfaces.

With a focus on building scalable and maintainable applications, Angular has been adopted by companies like Microsoft, Forbes, and PayPal. It is also the 2nd most popular modern frontend JavaScript framework after React.

Use Angular if you are building a large-scale application with complex business logic, or want to follow a strict and opinionated structure for your project and prefer to have all the necessary features and tools provided out of the box.

### 3. Svelte

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is a relatively new JavaScript framework that has gained popularity in recent years. The initial version of Svelte was launched by Rich Harris in 2016, who also created Rollup, a popular bundler for JavaScript modules.

It takes a different approach to build web applications compared to traditional frameworks like React and Angular. Rather than focusing on building reusable components, Svelte is designed to be more lightweight and performant. It does this by compiling components at build time, rather than at runtime, which can lead to faster load times and better performance.

Svelte was the 2nd most loved web framework and the most loved JavaScript framework in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022. It is also the highest paying JavaScript framework and is used by large companies like GoDaddy, 1Password, The New York Times, etc. 

Use Svelte when your application requires high interactivity and real-time updates and you want to use a framework that provides efficient rendering and optimized performance for your applications.

### 4. Vue

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It was developed by Evan You and was first released in February 2014. Vue is designed to be easy to adopt and integrate into other projects, and it has gained a lot of popularity among developers.

Vue is often compared to other popular JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular, but it has its own unique features and advantages. It has a minimalistic API and requires less boilerplate code than other frameworks, which makes it easier for developers to learn and use.

Vue is used by top companies like Netflix, Adobe, Gitlab, Behance, etc. It was also voted by 63.16% of developers as their most loved framework in 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey.

Use Vue when you want to use a framework that has a gentle learning curve and is easy to pick up for beginners and provides a more flexible and customizable approach to development.
